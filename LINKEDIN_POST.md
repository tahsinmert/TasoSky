🌌 Exploring the cosmos, one app at a time!

I'm thrilled to introduce TasoSky - an iOS app that makes space exploration accessible to everyone.

As a space enthusiast and developer, I wanted to create something that combines beautiful design with real NASA data. TasoSky lets you:
• Discover planets with interactive 3D views
• Track asteroids approaching Earth
• Monitor Mars weather in real-time

Every feature is designed with attention to detail, from parallax scrolling effects to smooth animations that bring the universe to life on your iPhone.

Open source and built with SwiftUI, this project represents my passion for both space science and mobile development.
